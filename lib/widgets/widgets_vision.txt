So, inside 'widgets' folder we also have defined
or divided this 'widgets' folder into two subfolders
'features' and 'global'.

Global:
 Is going to contain all the global widgets. let's say you're
 defining a card and that card is used allot of places so that
 card is global card right so, that thing u can keep in global.

Feature:
 there are some widgets which are feature based.
 let's say an instagram application and some widget
 are being used in the home page some are used in the
 search page.
 Some are used in the real space some are using the
 profile page so, all these features these are the sub
 features u can define separate folders for these features inside
 folders.

 And All the folders u can defined the widget
 perfect so, this is regarding widgets.
