So, what i'm having in the utilities i'm having colors.
so over here:

1. Colors:
u can write all the colors 'which' are going to use in
your project. 'dark' mode, white 'light' mode anything
u can use all the colors over here:
 i. click create a class.
 ii. inside that define the static color so that u can
 call these colors from any other class right so.

2. Constants:
 Constants let's say your height of the mobile screen
 width of the mobile screen then let's say your some
 constants, Some strings or any other some values all
 those u things u can keep in this constraints.

3. Images:
 So, which  u have defined in the icons folder and the
 images folder u can defined them in the 'images' folder

 in the 'images' file so that u don't need to write that
 'asset/images' so image from any other file right u just
  need to define all the strings over here for the assets
 files and then u just need to call them using 'static'
 keyword
 or u can call it directly from the variable perfect
 so this is about images.

4. Styles:
 let's say u are creating some button styles which u want to keep
 constant in all your application So, U can completely
 define it throught out the application.
 so, that's why i always define this 'styles.dart' so, that
 u keep all the 'styles'.

 let's say 'AppBar' styles ,'Container' styles, 'button' styles.
 Any style u can keep in 'styles.dart'.
