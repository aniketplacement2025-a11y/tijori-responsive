Inside the pages We Having two things
tabs so, basically we have around like 50-60%
of the applications are having this bottom
navigation bar right at the bottom u are having some
tabs.

You can check instagram or linkedin or any other social media
app u are having tabs so that's why we basically divide these pages
into tabs so, in this tabs folder we are having

So, Many tabs like tab1, tab2, tab3 and So on from '.dart' files.
                   ----------X----------

So, Basically In this 'pages' folder we have main file 'home.dart'
'home.dart' is basically called from the 'main.dart' So, in 'MyApp'
u can define 'home' So, the 'home.dart' will keep inside the pages only.
                  ----------X----------

Inside the 'pages' folder we have 'others' folder in which u keep more pages
let's say notification, settings screen or anything else so all the ui for
the pages for the tab will be inside 'pages' folder.

Obviously u can divide this 'pages' folder on different screen like
'feature1','feature2' and so on.
It's your choice if u have so many screen and u want to divide your features
accoding to screens.
                  -----------X------------
So, U can define one more folder called 'features' and then u can have separate features.
